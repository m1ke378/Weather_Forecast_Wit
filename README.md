# Weather Forecast Challenge

ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [https://weather-forecast-wit.vercel.app](https://weather-forecast-wit.vercel.app)

This is a responsive weather forecast web app built with Next.js and TypeScript. 
It allows users to search for a city, view the 5-day forecast with 3-hour intervals, see a detailed temperature chart for each day, and interact with a temperature map centered on that city.

Powered by:
  - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API for weather data and icons;
  - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) API for map data;
  - [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to combine weather and map data to create an interactive teperature map;
